# nlp_project
final project for cs 4650/7650

This project was created to analyze headlines from MSNBC and Fox News regarding COVID-19. We set out to see if there was a difference in how the two organizations covered the pandemic using natural language processing techniques.

Directory Structure:
- All python code is located in the top level directory.
- Sample headlines are contained in /headlines

Installation Instructions:
- You may need to install the following libraries with pip or any other preffered methods:
  - stanza
  - textblob
  - sklearn
  - yellowbrick
  
 Running the code:
 - Get an API key from newsapi.org and paste it into the "YOUR API KEY HERE" part of headline_retriever.py
 - If you do not have an API key, I have uploaded some sample headline files in the /headlines directory
